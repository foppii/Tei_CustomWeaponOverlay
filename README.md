Heya, this is an add-on for Victor Sant's BattlerGraphicSetup and BattleMotions plugins. It allows you to set up custom weapon sprites fr battle beyond the basic rpgmaker ones. It SHOULD work with the rest of Victor's battle plugins, I think???? 

Since this is an add-on plugin that pulls from core pieces of Victor Sant's plugins and also cannot be used without Victor Engine, use Victor's TOS.
